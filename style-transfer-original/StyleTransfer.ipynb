    "1. Pick a content image and a style image\n",
    "2. Intialize the pastiche (the resulting image with the content of the content image and the style of the style image) - usually random noise\n",
    "3. Run the content and style image through a pretrained VGG model\n",
    "    - For the content image, extract the convolutional features from ONE layer\n",
    "    - For the style image, extract the convolutional features from several layers - this will help with encapsulating global and local features of the style image\n",
    "4. For each iteration of gradient descent\n",
    "    - Run the pastiche through the VGG model and extract features from specified layers\n",
    "    - Construct the loss, total loss = content loss + style loss\n",

    "## Part Two: Content Loss\n",
    "Remember that our loss can be split into a content loss and a style loss, both of which we want to minimize. To compare the content of the pastiche and the content image, we find the mean squared error between their corresponding feature matrices from layer 'r42' of the VGG Net. Let $P^\\ell$ be the feature matrix of the pastiche, and $C^\\ell$ be the feature matrix of the content image. Then we can calculate the content loss as we normally do when comparing tensors.\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{content} = w_C\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{w,c,h} (P^\\ell_{wch} - C^\\ell_{wch})^2$$\n",
    "Where the sum is just indexing into each element of the tensors, and $n$ is the total number of elements in the tensors. $w_C$ is a weight that we will put on the content loss so that the content/style losses will balance (and one will not but much bigger in magnitude than the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will focus on implementing the `ContentLoss` class in `style_transfer.py`. It may help to use `nn.MSELoss` when implementing `ContentLoss`. In addition, take a look at `vgg.py` and see how to extract the specific feature layers of the cnn given the layer name (look at the `forward` method)."

    "Implement `construct_style_loss_fns` and `construct_content_loss_fns`. In order to implement this functions, you will need to construct a list of StyleLoss or ContentLoss (depending on the function) for each specified layer. In addition, you will need to know how much each loss will be weighted. The content layer loss weight is just $1.0$. For each style layer, the loss weight is $w = (\\frac{1000}{n})^2$, where $n$ is the number of output filters of the corresponding most recent convolutional layer."
